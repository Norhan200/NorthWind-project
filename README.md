# NorthWind-project
In this Northwind dashboard project, the goal was to visualize key sales metrics such as net sales, customer count, and shipping costs across various countries and time periods. The solution involved creating interactive dashboards to track customer behavior, top products and customers by revenue, as well as discounts and profit margins.
